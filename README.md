 ## Home-Page <br>
Upon loading the page, the user will be presented with the homepage, which includes a greeting with their name(if they are logged in), a motivational quote, the _logo_, _blogs_, _create a blog_ and _profiles_.
    
>The user can acess the blogs created by other blogs and view the content of these blogs without needing to login
2. 
## Blogs <br>
On the blog page, a guess will have access to all the blogs to be viewed. The blog page will feature many blogs with their title, owner name, and summary
> If the user is viewing their own blogs, they get the ability to edit, update, or delete it upon clicking the view blog button. The full article of the particular blog is available to be viewed only after opening the blog, which will redirect the user to a view page.

>If there are no blogs yet, there will be a page to notified you of such and provide you with a link to create a blog, only after you have logged in.

>The create blog forms will ask for the user's name, a title for the individual blog, a short summary of what the article is about, and the actual blog.

- The user will be presented with an option box that features many categories from frontend development, backend development, to UX/UI desgin. The image that represents the blog post is dependant on the category that the user selects. <br>
    - There is also a checkbox at the bottom of the page for the user to select and notify the users whether their specific blog is educational or not. <br>

The contributors page is where you can view a profile of anyone that has ever logged into the app. This profile will feature an avatar of the user, their name, and a link that will redirect you to that user's specific page.

> As user, you have access to the user's information, which features their name, their job, their brand statement along with their skills and a button to get in touch with such user.

> If the user has not written a brand statement yet, there is one that is already written for them and will be displayed.


> As the user of the profile you are viewing, you have access to everything other users have and more. You can add in any skills you want and you can delete skills. You also have the ability to add and edit your brand statement. 

>There is a section at the bottom of the page that explains what a brand statement is and how to write one.

# SPECIAL THANKS
- First and foremost, to all my instrcutors and peers from GA SEIR-EC-6-7. Everyone helped me one way or the other with this project and I am eternally grateful to all of them. Special shoutout to [Sam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-gemberling/) for helping me with most of the debugging issues I encountered.

- [albertwalicki](https://www.albertwalicki.com/glassmorphism-how-to-create) - This website's guide on how to design a glassmorphism website was my main inspiration for the look I decided to implement on the website.

- The Engineering Channel - All of my problems that couldn't be resolved with stackoverflow were easily resolved throught the engineering channel.

- [speckyboy](https://speckyboy.com/code-snippet-form-ui/) - Although I did not take any of the codes used as examples on this site, seeing how others approached forms in CSS gave me some ideas as to how to style my own.


- [Stackoflow](www.stackoverflow.com) - Links for each function from stack overflow that was tweaked will be included in the comments at the end of the JS file.
